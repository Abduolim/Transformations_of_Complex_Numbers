# Complex Number Transformations

## Overview

This web application visualizes various transformations of complex numbers using Flask, Python, and Matplotlib. The app allows users to input complex numbers and interact with different mathematical operations, including reflection, circle transformations, and fractional linear transformations. The transformations are graphically represented in the complex plane, offering an interactive learning experience.

The application can be used to explore and understand the geometric behavior of complex numbers under various transformations.

## Features

1. **Reflection of a Single Complex Number**  
   Reflect a complex number \( z \) using the formula \( w = a \cdot z + b \) and visualize the original and reflected points on the complex plane.

2. **Reflection of a Polygon**  
   Apply the same transformation to each vertex of a polygon and visualize the original and reflected polygons.

3. **Transformation of a Circle**  
   Visualize how a circle (centered at \( o \) with radius \( r \)) transforms under the linear transformation \( w = a \cdot z + b \), scaling the radius and shifting the center.

4. **Fractional Linear Transformation**  
   Apply fractional linear transformations of the form:
   \[
   w = \frac{a \cdot z + b}{c \cdot z + d}
   \]
   and visualize the transformation of a single complex number \( z \).
